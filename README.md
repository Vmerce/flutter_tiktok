# flutter_tiktok

A flutter app imitating Douyin. It mainly realizes the function of watching video, you can swipe the video very smoothly, slide left and right, and click a little love.

Flutter_web is currently supported, but the experience in mobile browsers is very limited.

# New features (in development)

ðŸŽ‰Welcome everyone to pay attention to this project. I originally wanted to wait for the official videoplayer to support all platforms before expanding to all platforms.

But now I see that there are players for various platforms on pub, so this project will soon support all platforms ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

The following features are under development and planned to be supported:

- Re-enable fijkplayer on iOS/Android system
- Support MacOS system
- Support Linux system
- Support Windows system

# Project FAQ
1. ** and Douyin are not like **: the main interaction has been fully realized, and you can modify the page according to your own business needs.
2. **UI performance issues**: On both Android and iOS, this project is very smooth and has no performance issues. It will be relatively laggy on the web, especially on the mobile web platform, because the performance of the flutter web itself is limited, and the performance of the mobile browser is also weak, so we can only wait for the official optimization here.

# implement the function

- Swipe the video up and down, the video will automatically load the cover, support unlimited pull-down to load the video, dynamically add a player, and control the memory usage
- Support the player before releasing, and support re-init when sliding back (does not depend on widget life cycle)
- Support preload video, you can control the number of preload
- Swipe left and right to search and personal center
- Double click to like the heart
- see comments
- Toggle Bottom Tabbar

# detail

Adapted to different scale screens, on slender screens, the bottom tabbar will not be superimposed on the video:

The picture shows the effect of forced adjustment under debug. The App will automatically determine the current screen ratio of the phone.


# other

For other pages that do not belong to the video business, the style is simply copied. If you need to customize the project, you can simply replace it with various pages written by yourself.

If you need to add videos infinitely, you only need to add videos to the array when the PageView slides to the end, it's very simple.

After loading a certain amount of video, remember to release the unused player to avoid flashback due to too much memory usage.
